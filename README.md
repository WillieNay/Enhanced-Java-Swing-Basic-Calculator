# Enhanced Java Swing Basic Calculator

## Project Description

This project is a basic arithmetic calculator application developed using Java Swing. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for performing simple calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application focuses on clean design, intuitive user interaction, and robust error handling.

## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **User-Friendly GUI:** Clean and intuitive graphical interface.
* **Input Validation:** Handles invalid input (non-numeric input, division by zero).
* **Visual Enhancements:** Uses color, padding, and layout management for a better user experience.
* **Clear Result Display:** Displays the calculated result in a dedicated label.
* **Operation Selection:** Uses a `JComboBox` for selecting arithmetic operations.

## Technology Stack

* **Java:** Programming language.
* **Java Swing:** GUI toolkit.
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Development environment.
